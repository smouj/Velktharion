**A mythic browser mind that remembers every strategic click.**

## Vision
Velktharion is designed as a production-minded AI skill for the **smouj SuperAgents Universe**. It solves real operational friction by combining autonomous reasoning, local-first execution, and transparent decision traces. The goal is not just automation, but **reliable autonomy**: repeatable, auditable, and safe by default. It is built to operate standalone or as a module inside larger multi-agent systems.

## Core Superpower
- ⚡ **Autonomous Web Navigation with Persistent Memory**

## Current Status (February 2026)
- 🚧 In ideation and initial scaffolding phase
- Next milestones:
  - [ ] Define domain-driven folder structure
  - [ ] Ship minimal runnable CLI + config profile
  - [ ] Integrate Ollama local model gateway
  - [ ] Add one end-to-end functional example
  - [ ] Implement test suite (unit + smoke)
  - [ ] Publish full technical docs and architecture diagram

## Planned Architecture (2026 free/open-source stack)
- **Primary language:** Python 3.11+
- **Agent framework:** LangGraph
- **Local models:** Ollama (Llama 3.1, Qwen2.5, DeepSeek-Coder, Mistral)
- **Core dependencies:** playwright, chromadb, beautifulsoup4, pydantic, tenacity
- **Execution model:** local-first, optional self-hosted deployment (n8n / Railway / Fly.io free tier)

## Installation (early scaffolding)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/smouj/Velktharion.git
cd Velktharion
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Roadmap Logic
1. **Foundation:** strict interfaces, typed contracts, config-first behavior
2. **Reasoning:** deterministic chains + fallback policy for critical actions
3. **Tooling:** adapter layer for browser, files, APIs, queues, and messaging
4. **Observability:** structured logs, metrics hooks, and replayable traces
5. **Safety:** policy gates for destructive or sensitive operations
6. **Scale-out:** compose with other skills through clean multi-agent boundaries
